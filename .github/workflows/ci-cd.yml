# Define when this workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master] # Run on pushes to main or master branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master] # Run on PRs targeting main or master branch

# Define the jobs in the workflow
jobs:

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use Ubuntu as the operating system
